This project includes 2 Eclipse plugins that work to automatically generate an Android ContentProvider and all the necessary boiler plate code to make it work in your project. There are several dependencies:

-Ecore Tools SDK
-EMF - Eclipse Modeling Framework SDK
-XPand SDK
-Xtext SDK

These two projects are then compiled into jars and put in the dropins folder of your eclipse installation. These will be available for download later, or you can get the source and build them yourself.
